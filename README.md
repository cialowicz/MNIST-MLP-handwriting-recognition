# MNIST Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to Recognize Hand-written Numbers

This exercise involved training a neural network to recognize hand-written numbers using pytorch (and was part of the [Udacity Deep Learning / ML nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101)). This network was able to achieve a test accuracy of 98%.
